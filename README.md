# UXBOX UI

UI design and development. Where the magic happens ;) 

## Run for development

First of all, you must install the global dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g bower gulp
```

After this, you will need to install the local dependencies of the application:

```bash
npm install
```

## Project tasks

To run the project, just run `gulp`. To create the project distribution, run `gulp dist`
